## Introduction
introduction to your dataset
Analysis Question: What is the relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes? Do recipes have higher ratings tend to take shorter time than the recipes of lower ratings? (Do recipes that take shorter time have higher ratings?)


Why should readers of your website care about the dataset and your question specifically?
Report the number of rows in the dataset, the names of the columns that are relevant to your question, and 

### descriptions of relevant columns:
`'name'` : Recipe name
`'id'`
`'rating'` 
`'minutes'`
| Column            | Description                             |
|:------------------|----------------------------------------:|
| `'name'`          | Recipe name                             |
| `'id'`            | Recipe ID                               |
| `'rating'`        | Average Rating of the recipe as floats  |
| `'minutes'`       | Minutes to prepare recipe as integers   |


| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `'name'` | Recipe name |

## Cleaning and EDA
### Data Cleaning
#### Data Cleaning Steps: 
1.  In the getting the data part, we have two dataframes, `'recipes'` and `'interactions'`. Left merge them.
2.  In the merged dataset, fill all ratings of 0 with np.nan. This is **neccessary** because if a recipe is rated 0, it means a reviewer did not enter the rating. So it can be seen as a column containing missing values.
3.  Find the average rating of invidividual recipes and add this Series as `'rating'` column to recipes dataframe. We will use the average rating `'rating'` in the analysis part.
4.  Originally, `'nutrition'` contains nutritions as a list of values. We create individual columns for every unique nutritions.
5.  We create the column `'rating > 3'`, which stores boolean values to indicate whether the rating is greater than 3. If rating is greater than 3, we define it as a high-rating recipe, otherwise a low-rating recipe. This information will be used in our analysis. 
6. For our Bivariate Analysis, we want to know whether a recipe's calories is high or low. We define a recipe that has at least 400 calores to be a high-calorie recipe. Therefore, we create a column high_calories, which stores boolean values to indicate whether the recipe is a high-calorie recipe or not.

**explanation**
The distributions of minutes between high_rating recipes and low_rating recipes are similar. In other words, no matter the recipe is rated high or low, they have similar trend that most recipes take under 60 minutes, and there are fewer recipes that take longer time. There is no obvious differences between high and low ratings of a recipe by looking at how long it takes.

### Interesting Aggregates


## Assessment of Missingness
### NMAR Analysis
We believe the `'rating'` column is not missing at random(NMAR), the chance that a value is missing depends on the actual missing value. For example, the user is less likely to fill in a 3 when they feel neutral towards the recipe, compared to 5 and 1 when they are extremely satified or dissatisfied.

any additional data you might want to obtain that could explain the missingness (thereby making it MAR).

### Missingness Dependency

#### Results of Missingness Permutation Tests
```py
ks_2samp(recipes_df.loc[recipes_df['description missing'] == True, 'n_steps'], recipes_df.loc[recipes_df['description missing'] == False, 'n_ingredients'])
